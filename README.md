**From an idea, hoping for a shareable invention:  Help us build an open-source vertical mobility device!**

---

## What is ScaLino?

ScaLino is an **open-source project** aiming to develop a practical and accessible vertical mobility device.  Designed to empower people with mobility challenges, particularly in homes that are not equipped with elevators, ScaLino seeks to provide a solution for navigating multi-story dwellings and overcoming vertical barriers in tight spaces.

This project is more than just a technical endeavor; it's a **community effort** driven by the desire to improve accessibility and quality of life for individuals facing mobility limitations.  We believe in the power of open collaboration to create innovative and impactful solutions, and we invite you to join us in building ScaLino!

## The Story Behind ScaLino

This project began with a deeply personal experience. My father suffered a stroke and lost his mobility.  Witnessing the challenges he faced daily, especially in our beautiful, historic city where older buildings often lack accessibility features, was deeply impactful.  In Perugia, Italy, where we live in the historical center, I saw firsthand how homes often lack elevators, and how existing disability devices struggle with the non-linear staircases of these buildings.

Hoping to improve his quality of life and make it easier for him to navigate our city, I started imagining a device that could provide vertical mobility.  Sadly, my father passed away.  However, my hope now is that by making this invention open source, I can help others worldwide facing similar mobility barriers in historic urban environments, transforming my personal experience into a positive contribution for many.

## Features (Current & Envisioned)

**(Please note: ScaLino is currently in its early stages of development.  The features listed below represent the initial vision and goals for the project.)**

*   **Vertical Lifting/Lowering Mechanism:**  The core function of ScaLino is to safely and reliably move a person vertically between floors or levels.
*   **Compact Design:**  Designed for use in narrow and confined spaces typical of older homes and historic buildings.
*   **Adaptability to Non-Linear Staircases:**  Exploring solutions to accommodate staircases that are not perfectly straight, a common challenge in historic architecture.
*   **User-Friendly Controls:**  Intuitive and easy-to-use controls for operation by individuals with varying levels of dexterity.
*   **Safety Features:**  Prioritizing safety with features like emergency stops, secure platform, and robust construction.
*   **Open-Source Design:**  All design files, documentation, and software (if applicable) will be openly available and modifiable.
*   **Community-Driven Development:**  Built collaboratively by a community of contributors, ensuring diverse perspectives and continuous improvement.
